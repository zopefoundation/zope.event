:mod:`zope.event` Documentation
===============================

This package provides a simple event system on which
application-specific event systems can be built.

Application code can generate events without being concerned about the
event-processing frameworks that might handle the events.

Events are objects that represent something happening in a system.
They are used to extend processing by providing processing plug
points.
